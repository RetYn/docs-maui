Google Play â€“ Publishes a signed APK to Google Play. Continue to Publishing to Google Play to learn how to sign and publish an AAB in the Google Play store.

Android requires that *.AAB* files are

Process:

- Create a Google Play Developer account
- Sign your bundle
- Deploy to Google Play
- Deploy from Visual Studio
- Release to production

## Keystores

Keystores are binary files that serve as repositories of certificates and private keys.

## Create a Google Play Developer account

To publish Android apps on Google Play, you'll need to create a Google Play Developer account:

1. Using your Google Account, sign up for a [Google Play Developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup).
1. Enter information about your developer identity
1. During the sign-up process, you'll need to review and accept the [Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement](https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html).
1. Pay the one-time $25 registration fee.
1. Verify your identity by following the instructions in your verification email.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Identity verification must be complete before you can publish apps through Google Play.

Once your Google Play Developer Account has been created you'll be able to publish apps to Google Play.

For more information, see [Register for a Google Play Developer account](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en-GB#zippy=) on support.google.com.

## Create your app in Google Play Console

After you've created your Google Play Developer account, you'll need to create an app and set it up using Google Play Console:

1. Login to your [Google Play Developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).
1. In **Google Play Console**, on the **All apps** tab, select the **Create app** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/google-play-create-new-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the all apps page in Google Play.":::

1. In the **Create app** page, enter your app details and select the **Create app** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/google-play-create-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new app in Google Play.":::

    For more information about creating an app in Google Play Console, see [Create and set up your app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152) on support.google.com.

## Setup your app in Google Play Console

After creating your app, you should set it up. Your app's dashboard will guide you through all the most important steps.

To start setting up your app, select **Dashboard** at the left menu. Under your app's details at the top of the page you'll find different categories and tasks relating to app setup and release. You must complete the mandatory tasks before you can launch your app on Google Play. When you complete a task you'll see a green tick mark and strikethrough text. The progress bar at the top of the section will also be updated. For more information, see [Set up your app on the app dashboard](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859454) on support.google.com.

## Ad hoc publish

## Prepare a release

A release is a combination of one or more app versions that you'll prepare to launch an app, or roll out an update. You can create a release on the following tracks:

- Open testing. Open testing releases are available to testers on Google Play. Users can join tests from your Store listing.
- Closed testing. Closed testing releases are available to a limited number of testers that you choose, who can test a pre-release version of your app and submit feedback.
- Internal testing. Internal testing releases are available to up to 100 testers that you can choose.
- Production. Production releases are available to all Google Play users in your chosen countries.

    A new keystore, which contains a new certificate, will be saved to **C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Xamarin\Mono for Android\Keystore\{Alias}\{Alias}.keystore**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The keystore and password isn't saved to your Visual Studio solution. Therefore, ensure you back up this data. If you lose it you'll be unable to sign your app with the same signing identity.

  > Don't close the web browser.

1. In Visual Studio, in the **Distribute - Google Play Account** dialog, select **Continue**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/distribution-google-api-access-authorized.png" alt-text="Screenshot of authorized Google API access in Visual Studio.":::

1. In the **Distribute - Google Play Track** dialog, select the track to upload your app to. Google Play offers five tracks for uploading your app:

  - Internal should be used for quickly distributing your app for internal testing and quality assurance checks.
  - Alpha should be used for uploading an early version of your app to a small group of testers.
  - Beta should be used for uploading an early version of your app to a larger group of testers.
  - Production should be used for full distribution to the Google Play store.
  - Custom should be used for testing pre-release versions of your app with specific users by creating a list of testers by email address.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > If you don't see the custom track, ensure you've created a release for that track in the Google Play Console. For more information, see [Prepare and roll out a release](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859348?hl=en&visit_id=638192315525080840-296240211&rd=1) on support.google.com.

  Select the track to upload your app to and then select the **Upload** button:

  :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/distribution-select-google-play-track.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a Google Play Track prior to uploading your app.":::

  For more information about Google Play testing, see [Set up an open, closed, or internal test](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9845334?hl=en&visit_id=638192315525080840-296240211&rd=1) on support.google.com.

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/enter-password.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering your password for your signing identity in Visual Studio.":::

Visual Studio will sign your app bundle and upload it to Google Play.

## Manually upload to Google Play

The first time an AAB is submitted to Google Play, it must be manually uploaded through the Google Play Console. This enables Google Play to match the signature of the key on all future bundles to the original key used for the first version of the app.

Steps:

1. Create an ad-hoc AAB. Although the app will be distributed via Google Play it must be manually uploaded the first time (otherwise error).


## Upload to Google Play from Visual Studio
