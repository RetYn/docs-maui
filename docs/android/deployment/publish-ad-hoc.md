Ad-Hoc â€“ Saves a signed AAB to disk that can be sideloaded to Android devices. Continue to Signing the App Package to learn how to create an Android signing identity, create a new signing certificate for Android applications, and publish an ad hoc version of the app to disk. This is a good way to create an APK for testing.

This section explains how to create an Android signing identity, create a new signing certificate for Android applications, and publish the archived app ad hoc to disk. The resulting AAB can be sideloaded into Android devices without going through an app store.

## Ensure correct package format

By default, the package format for .NET MAUI Android release builds is AAB. To publish a .NET MAUI Android app for side loading requires that you first change the package format to APK:

1. In **Solution Explorer** right-click on your .NET MAUI app project and select **Properties**. Then, navigate to the **Android > Options** tab and ensure that the value of the **Release** field is set to **apk**:

## Publish

[!INCLUDE [Publish](../includes/publish-vs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Publish ad-hoc](../includes/publish-ad-hoc.md)]

The app can then be distributed to Android devices through a website, or email. When users browse to a download link from their Android-powered device, the file is downloaded and Android automatically starts installing it on the device.
